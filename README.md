Pseudocode Assignment

Counting up people in a room
n = total people in the room = 250

A. Algorithm #1

1 enter the room
2 set n = 0
3 for every pair of people in the room
     Set n = n + 2

Complexity: O(n/2)

B. Algorithm #2

1 enter the room
2 set n = 0
3 for every 5 people in the room
     Set n = n + 5
  
Complexity: O(n/5)
